## Code Golf

Today we are going to do some ARM code golf. We have written some of these programs previously so try to modify/optimise your programs.

Do not modify the templates given other than adding your solution between comments or adding functions below.
Try to solve the challenges using the least line, not characters.

### Challenge 1 - Factorial
Write a program which takes a number (n) in register 0 and then produces the factorial of that number and leaves it in register 1.

### Challenge 2 - Fibonacci
Write a program which takes a number (n) in register 0 and then produces the nth value of fibonacci (0,1,1,2,3,5,8...) and leaves it in register 1.

e.g. if input is 0, return 0. If input is 6, return 8.

### Challenge 3 (Hard) - Wave Generation
Using the template provided, write a program to produce a wave (any shape) of 480hz.
